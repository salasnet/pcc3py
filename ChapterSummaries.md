# Python Crash Course Code Chapter Summaries

## Chapter 1
In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed Python on your system if it wasn’t already there. You also installed a text editor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran snippets of Python code in a terminal session, and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. You probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.

## Chapter 2
In this chapter you learned how to work with variables. You learned to use descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise. You learned what strings are and how to display them using lowercase, uppercase, and title case. You started using whitespace to organize output neatly, and you learned how to remove unneeded elements from a string. You started working with integers and floats, and you learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data. You also learned to write explanatory comments to make your code easier for you and others to read.

Finally, you read about the philosophy of keeping your code as simple as possible, whenever possible.

## Chapter 3
In this chapter, you learned what lists are and how to work with the individual items in a list. You learned how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. You learned how to sort lists permanently and temporarily for display purposes. You also learned how to find the length of a list and how to avoid index errors when you’re working with lists.

## Chapter 4
In this chapter, you learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a list. You learned how to work through a list using a for loop, how Python uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a few operations you can perform on numerical lists. You learned how to slice a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a slice. You also learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldn’t change, and how to style your increasingly complex code to make it easy to read.
